You are an expert Python software engineer with experience in building desktop UI tools using PyQt6 and writing custom parsing/formatting engines. 

Generate complete working code for a Python desktop application called **"TCL Formatter & Syntax Debugger"**. 

This application should allow the user to select a .tcl file, automatically format the TCL code, and generate either a formatted output file or an error report.

The application requirements are:

1. Use **PyQt6** for the desktop UI.

2. UI should include:

   - A button to browse and select an input .tcl file

   - Display of the selected file path

   - Options checkboxes: 

       * Align set commands

       * Expand long lists to multiline formatting

       * Strict indentation mode

   - A "Format File" button

   - A status output area to show success message or errors with line numbers

3. After formatting, generate a formatted output file with suffix `_formatted.tcl` in the same directory.

4. If syntax errors exist (like unmatched `{` or `}` or quote issues), instead of formatting, produce an **errors.log** file listing the errors with line numbers.

5. Implement a formatting engine in Python with:

    - Indentation control using 2 spaces

    - Proper indentation based on block keywords (if, else, foreach, while, switch, proc, namespace)

    - Increase indent after a line ending in `{`

    - Decrease indent before a line starting with `}`

6. Implement brace and quote mismatch detection using a stack-based approach.

7. Include meaningful comments and clean structured code organization using:

    - main.py

    - formatter.py (formatting logic)

    - ui.py (PyQt interface)

8. Add an example TCL input file and demonstrate before/after formatting output.

Return the complete code with:

   - All .py files

   - instructions to run the application

   - any required pip install commands

   - example test case

  - application install and run command 



The generated code must be functional, clean, well-documented, and ready to run.
